abstract = {This article considers a problem of tracking, convergence of disturbance observer (DO) based optimal control design for uncertain surface vessels (SVs) with external disturbance. The advantage of proposed optimal control using adaptive/approximate reinforcement learning (ARL) is that consideration for whole SVs with only one dynamic equation and without conventional separation technique. Additionally, thanks to appropriate disturbance observer, the attraction region of tracking error is remarkably reduced. On the other hand, the particular case of optimal control problem is presented by directly solving for the purpose of choosing the suitable activation functions of ARL. Furthermore, the proposed ARL based optimal control also deals with non-autonomous property of closed tracking error SV model by considering the equivalent system. Based on the Lyapunov function candidate using optimal function and quadratic form of estimated error of actor/critic weight, the stability and convergence of the closed system are proven. Some examples are given to verify and demonstrate the effectiveness of the new control strategy.}

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

abstract = {We present a novel data structure, the Bayes tree, that provides an algorithmic foundation enabling a better understanding of existing graphical model inference algorithms and their connection to sparse matrix factorization methods. Similar to a clique tree, a Bayes tree encodes a factored probability density, but unlike the clique tree it is directed and maps more naturally to the square root information matrix of the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. In this paper, we highlight three insights provided by our new data structure. First, the Bayes tree provides a better understanding of the matrix factorization in terms of probability densities. Second, we show how the fairly abstract updates to a matrix factorization translate to a simple editing of the Bayes tree and its conditional densities. Third, we apply the Bayes tree to obtain a completely novel algorithm for sparse nonlinear incremental optimization, named iSAM2, which achieves improvements in efficiency through incremental variable re-ordering and fluid relinearization, eliminating the need for periodic batch steps. We analyze various properties of iSAM2 in detail, and show on a range of real and simulated datasets that our algorithm compares favorably with other recent mapping algorithms in both quality and efficiency.},
