This project aims to implement Craig Reynold’s behavioral rules to control a robot swarm within a 2D simulator Stage. The implementation begins with integrating basic Reynold’s rules such as Separation, Alignment, and Cohesion, followed by additional rules such as Navigation to a certain point and Obstacle avoidance. The robots simulated in the Stage simulator are omnidirectional points, that are evaluated in various maps to analyze their behavior across different environments.
