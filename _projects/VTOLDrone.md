The VTOL Drone - 1-6 UAV Project, developed by the UAV Center of Viettel High Techonology Corporation between 2016 and 2022, was designed to equip the Vietnam People's Army. With special features such as being compact and capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), Loitering with camera payload, operating in 6 hours, Maximum airspeed is 110 km/h. Because the project is belong to Vietnam People's Army, I can not public source code as well as important information.

## Personal Contributions and Skills Development
As a software and robotic engineer, I focused on the transition controller, which is belong to transition phase when the drone changed from quad-mode to fix-wing mode. It requires smooth transition, height overshoot not too big and save energy for the system. To handle them, I have to work with the lift of the aircraft in both quad mode and fixed-wing mode, from which I calculate the main motor controller as well as the quad motors to ensure a smooth and energy-efficient transition phase. Energy efficiency is crucial at this stage because, for VTOL aircraft, the quad system is only used twice—during takeoff and landing. Accurately calculating the required energy helps reduce the aircraft's payload and extend its operational time—an essential criterion for reconnaissance aircraft.

This project has significantly enhanced my expertise in robotics, aircraft and software engineering, preparing me for a future at the forefront of technological innovation. There, we have an opportunity to have deep know-how in aerodynamics of the plane and quadrotors to design a transition controller for VTOL aircraft from that. Besides, I enhance my C programming skills through developing software for autopilot.
